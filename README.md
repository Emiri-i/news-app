## :bulb: Room for Improvement

Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:

- Record which country and category are used the last time to set the default value for the next time when the website is visited.
- Separate the search filter function. Would like to make 1 page for keyword search and the other page for category and country filter.
